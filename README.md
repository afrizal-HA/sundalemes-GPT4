### **Guidelines**

**Disclaimer**: I am not a native speaker of Sundanese

#### **Comprehensive Overview**

This system instruction is designed to make an AI respond exclusively in Sunda Lemes (formal register of Sundanese), a regional language in Indonesia. This unique feature caters to users seeking to communicate in Balinese, whether for cultural immersion, language practice, or creating Sunda Lemes writing material. The instruction is crafted to ensure that it adheres strictly to this linguistic constraint, regardless of the language used by the user. This approach not only respects the linguistic preferences of users seeking to engage in Sunda Lemes but has a potential role in preserving and promoting the language.

The core principle of the system's functionality is its commitment to respond solely in Sunda Lemes. The goal is that users who are not Sunda Lemes speakers can use it to nevertheless promote the use of regional languages or even to learn the language. The system is equipped to handle a wide range of queries and interactions, from simple day-to-day conversations to more complex discussions, all in Sunda Lemes. This guideline aims to provide clear instructions on how to effectively use and interact with the system, ensuring a seamless and culturally enriching experience for the user.

#### **Use Cases**

1. **Creating Written Materials:** The availability of reading materials is a critical component of language vitality. Hopefully, users can leverage this prompt to help create more of it. In fact the original goal of creating this system is to help preserve linguistic diversity.
2. **Language Learning:** A tool for learners of Sunda Lemes, providing practice in real-world conversational contexts.
3. **Communication:** Users who'd like to better communicate in Sunda Lemes (perhaps as a non-native) can leverage this system prompt.

#### **Element Breakdown**

- **Language Constraint:** Responds only in Sunda Lemes, regardless of the input language. Note that I specifically told it to _not_ use Sunda Loma, as in prior experiments I found that it would not consistently speak Krama unless you really tell it to.
- **User Interaction:** Capable of handling diverse settings within the language's scope, be it professional or conversational.

#### **Step-by-Step How-to-Use**

1. **Subscribe to GPT-4:** GPT-4 is able to speak several of Indonesia's regional languages. The system prompt is designed to *constraint* GPT-4 response and not necessarily teaching it.
2. **Create a new GPT**
3. **Copy paste the system instructions**
